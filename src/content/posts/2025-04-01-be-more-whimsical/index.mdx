  **This is an [April Cools' Club](https://www.aprilcools.club/) post.** 
  
  April Cools is all about producing genuine content that's very different from your normal produced content. 
  
  I usually use this blog to write about technical topics in (software) engineering, but I'd like to take this opportunity to write something a bit more reflective.

## Most of life is boring.

Some of life can be exciting. But most of it is boring.

- Morning routines are boring (wake up, brush teeth, eat breakfast, commute to work). 
- Most of work is boring (if your day job is amazing every day of the week, then all the power to you... but more likely than not, it's far from that for most of the workday everyday). 
- Doing the dishes is boring. 
- Relaxing after work is nice. But a lot of the time it's boring.

It's different for everyone, yes, but some part of life always remains mundane. I wouldn't believe anyone who says that they enjoy every single moment of their day (if everything is enjoyable, then nothing is).

The worst part is: *it doesn't stop*. The boring parts of life continue day-in, day-out, for the rest of your adult life (the kids have it good, but they're not old enough to realize that yet).

**We spend most of our lives doing things we don't want to do.**

## There's nothing stopping you from making the mundane things in life more fun

I was scrolling mindlessly on Reddit the other day, going through the assortment of news, memes, and random posts from the subreddits I follow (mainly tech, local, and some hobbies), when I came across a post that (out of absolute nowhere) brightened my day.

I came across a Reddit post a few weeks ago that did something social media rarely does for me: it absolutely brightened my day.

I saved the link as soon as I opened that post, because I knew that it was something worth saving. 

I was curious and wanted to see if I could find the post from looking . I was curious and checked out the top posts in that subreddit too. well, turns out that post already became the all-time top post in that subreddit in less than a month. Go figure. Just goes to show that everyone is looking for a little more whimsy in their life.

  As I formally begin ECE496 in September 2025, I'll be updating this timeline with more specific dates, along with experiences and any tips I have for future students taking the course.

The engineering capstone design project course (ECE496) is arguably the most important course you'll take in your entire undergrad at UofT Engineering, let alone in your final year. It's a year-long course that runs from September to April and is an opportunity for you to work on a real-world engineering project from idea formation to (hopefully) a working established prototype.

There's not much information available online about what the course is actually like, so I've decided to share a comprehensive timeline of what the ECE496 experience is like from my 4th year of engineering undergrad.
