## You should go to Magellan 101

It's finally that time of the (school) year: the deadline to select your courses next year for 2nd/3rd year students in electrical & computer engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto (UofT) is fast approaching (*January 30th at 11:59pm!*), and you're still not quite sure on what you should take.

**Magellan 101** is one of the events that the ECE Club at UofT hosts every year for upper year students like me to give course advice, and I'm actually volunteering to speak in this year's session so I thought I might as well take ~~pen to paper~~ keyboard to screen and write down everything I'd like to say.

Which is why (if you haven't attended a previous session already) you should probably head to the Magellan 101 session is this Tuesday, so if you're a second year student looking to get some advice on .

I'll be there volunteering, so if there's any questions.

### Info for the uninitiated

Magellan is a tool that UofT ECE students use to plan their courses. It's a bit of a pain to use, but it's the only way to *officially* plan your courses (i.e. **guarantee** that you'll be enrolled in your selected ECE courses), which pretty much leaves you no choice (unless you're willing to run the gauntlet that is waking before 6am the day course enrolment opens on Acorn and then dealing with the lag from several thousand students absolutely annihilating the poor probably-decade-old mainframe hosting the course enrolment service at the university; note you'll still need to wake up at dawn this for your non-ECE courses in the summer, so it won't save you entirely from that pain). 

You can check out Magellan at [here](https://magellan.ece.utoronto.ca/).

## The basics of course enrolment 

Alright, let's get the boring technical stuff out of the way first.

The ECE curriculum at UofT is divided into 6 areas:


### Graduation requirements

To graduate from ECE at UofT you need to have taken:

- All your 1st and 2nd year courses
- Breadth requirement: 4 kernel courses from 4 different areas
- Depth requirement: 2 courses from 2 of the areas where you took a kernel course
- 3 technical electives
- 1 science elective
- 4 complementary studies (HSS) electives -- of which at least are 2 humanities and social sciences (HSS) electives
- The engineering economic analysis & entrepreneurship course (ECE472)
- 4th year capstone design project course
- A free elective (literally any course at UofT that you are able to take, including non-engineering courses)

<Callout type="info">
  You'll also need 600 hours of practical work experience to graduate, but if you're in the PEY Co-op program (or even just working over the summer) then you'll reach those hours with no trouble at all.

## General tips

### Do the courses you care about first

If you're interested in a course, take it. Don't worry about whether it's a kernel course or not, or whether it's in the area you're interested in. You're going to be spending a lot of time on these courses, so you might as well enjoy them.

## Course selection by area

As a software guy, my interests and experiences really only stretch as far as areas 5 (computer hardware & computer networks) and 6 (software), so I'll be focusing on those areas in this post.

However, I've been able to gather some information on the other areas from friends and upper year students, so I'll try to include that information as well below.

## Software (Area 6)

### Operating Systems (ECE344)

ECE344 is probably my favourite course from all of undergrad. It's an introduction 

It's a kernel course, a must-have for anyone working in the software space, and also one of my favourite courses from undergrad.
