Previously, I wrote about how to use the Astro Content Loader API to get data from Goodreads and use that data to dynamically build Goodread components in Astro. Since then, I've rewritten the code to a NPM package (including some improvements!), so now it's even easier than before to use Goodreads data in your Astro projects.
